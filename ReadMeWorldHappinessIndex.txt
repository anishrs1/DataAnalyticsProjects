In this project, I imported the world happiness dataset which showed the values about GDP per capita, life expectancy,
social support, freedom to make life choices and perceptions of corruption for all countries in the world. Afterwards,
I plotted the correlation matrix to find out which type of values most influence the happiness index score. Then, I used 
the scaterplot function from matplotlib package to further illustrate the level of impact every single variable had on 
each country's happiness score. Based on the results, social support from family and friends, GDP per capita and life 
expectancy are the variables that had the biggest influence on the final happiness score for every country in the dataset.
