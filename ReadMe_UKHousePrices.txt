The purpose of this project is to analyze the relation between house prices and salaries
in the UK from 1975-2020. We are trying to find out if house prices have significantly
outgrown salaries or if salaries have kept up with increase in house prices. First, we
imported pandas, seaborn and matplotlibrary packages. Then, we used pandas to make a 
scatterplot of both house prices as well as salaries form the years 1975 to 2020. Afterwards,
we used matplotlibrary to display the scatterplots. From the results, the conclusion is
that salaries with respect to inflation have slightly decreased while house prices had
constantly increased over the years.
