This program is used to recommend articles to users. In order to do that,
we use cosine similarity method for building the recommendation system based
on content. First we import the dataset about some articles from a particular
website. Then, we use clustering algorithm in machine learning to create
the list of recommended articles for our users that will align well with their
interests.
